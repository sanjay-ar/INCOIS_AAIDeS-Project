#Automated Animal Identification and Detection of Species

**Mission:** Empower fishermen through cutting-edge technology by revolutionizing the fishing industry with a sustainable and efficient approach.

## Project Overview

The **INCOIS_AAIDeS Project** leverages advanced deep learning techniques to analyze fish behavior directly from the net. This innovative system aims to:

- Optimize fishing efficiency.
- Promote sustainability in marine ecosystems.
- Provide actionable insights to fishermen for better decision-making.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Model:** Analyzes fish species and behaviors using real-time data.
- **Automation:** Reduces manual labor and errors in fish identification.
- **Sustainability:** Ensures responsible fishing practices by monitoring fish populations.

## File Structure

### `fish.py`

This is the core script for the **AAIDeS** project. It includes:

- **Model Implementation:** Deep learning algorithms for detecting and identifying fish species.
- **Data Processing:** Functions for preprocessing inputs (images/videos).
- **Prediction Pipeline:** Generates insights based on netted fish behavior.

## Prerequisites

- **Programming Language:** Python 3.7+
- **Libraries:**
  - TensorFlow
  - OpenCV
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Pandas
